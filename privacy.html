                     <p>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</p>

                     <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/</p> 

                     <h3 class="mt-2">According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</h3>

                     <h3 class="mt-2">Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</h3>

                     <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p> 

                     <p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.</p>

                     <h3 class="mt-2">Service Providers</h3>

                     <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (“Service Providers”), provide Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services or assist us in analysing how our Service is used.</p>

                     <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
